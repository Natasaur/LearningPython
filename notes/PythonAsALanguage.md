## Syntax Errors
We need to learn Python Language so we can communicate our instructions to Python.
**You must remember that you're intelligent and can learn.**
**The computer is simple and very fast, but cannot learn.**

## Elements of Python
**- Vocabulary/Words:** Variables and reserved words.
**- Sentence Structure:** Valid syntax patterns.
**-Story Structure:** Constructing a program for a purpose.

Example:

```
name = raw input('Enter file: ')
handle = open(name)

counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    word = line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[words] = counts.get(words,0) + 1
```
